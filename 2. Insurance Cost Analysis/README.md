## 📌 Insurance-Cost-Analysis with Python

### Project Overview :

*Conduct analytical study on a curated medical insurance charges dataset. Dataset adapted from Medical Insurance Price Prediction*
### Objective : 
• *Identify primary factors affecting insurance costs and develop predictive models*
### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
• *Python v3.12.2 – programming environment*
* *Pandas – data manipulation and preprocessing* 
* *NumPy – statistical and mathematical operations*   
* *Scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms, pipelines, and evaluation*     
* *Seaborn – advanced data visualization*     
* *Matplotlib – flexible plotting and charting*

### 📊 Dashboards & Analysis

* *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
* *Visualized distributions of charges by smoker status, BMI ranges, and regions.*
* *Correlation heatmaps identified smoking & BMI as dominant predictors of cost.*
  
💫 Project Achievements 

→ *Identified key cost drivers: smoking status (strongest), BMI, age, and number of children significantly impact insurance charges.*  
→ *Developed Linear Regression model with only smoker attribute → R² = 0.62 (baseline).*   
→ *Expanded to all features → R² improved to 0.75, showing better prediction power*.    
→ *Applied Polynomial Regression → achieved R² = 0.84, capturing non-linear relationships.*    
→ *Used Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features → further improved to R² = 0.85, reducing overfitting.*

### 📈 Trend Analysis:
* *Insurance cost increases with age & BMI.*
* *Smokers incur ~79% higher charges on average.*
* *Regional variation minimal, indicating location is less significant.*

### 🔹 Project Findings & Outcomes

✅ *Achieved 85% R² accuracy using Linear, Polynomial & Ridge Regression. Identified smoking, BMI & age as key cost drivers, enabling optimized pricing strategies.*  
✅ *Built predictive models using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn; achieved 85% (R²) accuracy in forecasting insurance costs.*  
✅ *Uncovered key cost drivers (smoking, BMI, age) and delivered insights to optimize pricing strategies and reduce financial risks.*  
✅ *Smoking (~55%), BMI (~20%), and age (~15%) emerged as dominant cost drivers, jointly shaping most of the prediction power.*     
✅ *Final Accuracy Achieved : ~85% (R² = 0.8537)*
